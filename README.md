# Todo List Application

## Project Overview

This Todo List application allows users to manage their items effectively. Users can add, display, complete, and delete todos, with the option to implement additional features for an enhanced experience. The application is built using React and follows the Microsoft Fluent design guidelines.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Todo List Functionality

- **Add Todos:** Users should be able to add new todos, each with a title and an optional description.
- **Display Todos:** Todos are displayed in a clean and organized manner.
- **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark a todo as completed. Completed todos are visually distinct from incomplete ones (e.g., by striking through the text or changing the background color).
- **Delete Todos:** Users should be able to delete todos.

### 2. Optional Features (Choose 1 or more if you have extra time)

- **Filter Todos:** Allow users to filter the list by "All", "Completed", and "Incomplete" todos.
- **Edit Todos:** Enable users to edit the title and description of existing todos.
- **Persistent Storage:** Store todos in the browser's local storage to ensure they persist even after a page refresh.
- **Due Dates:** Add a due date to todos and visually indicate if a todo is overdue.

### 3. UI/UX Considerations

- The UI should be responsive, visually appealing, and based on Microsoft Fluent design.
- Provide proper feedback for user actions (e.g., messages when there are no todos, confirmation before deleting a todo, etc.).

### 4. Coding Requirements

- **Framework:** Use React to build the application. You can start the project using create-react-app.
- **File Format:** Source files must be in TypeScript (.tsx) format.
- **Components:** Use Functional Components and React Hooks.
- **Code Quality:** Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Comments and proper variable naming are appreciated.
- **Styling Guidelines:** Please adhere to the Fluent 2 styling guidelines [here](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/).
- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure your app works in Chromium-based browsers.
